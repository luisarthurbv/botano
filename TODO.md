## Bootstrap
* Have a better README.md explaining what this repo is about
* May have to write some scripts to initialize things
* May also have to have setup such as API KEY/tools (e.g. Claude, Codex and so on)

## Add tools!
* We need to be able to scaffold the output with the log and summary files
* We need to list all the tools we want to work well here.
* We should better adjust this repo for the Agents to use this content.
    * We need a tool to be able to create the output folder
